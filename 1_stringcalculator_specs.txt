StringCalculator
----------------

A StringCalculator provides an "add" method with one String parameter.
The output of the Add method is always an integer.

The "add" method accepts a String argument.
The input String can be a single number.
An empty String should return 0

The input String can be a comma separated String. The output should be the sum. 
	Example: "1,2" --> 3

The input String can also be separated by new lines (mixed with comma's). Ie:
	"1,2\n3" --> 6

The input String can optionally start with //. When it does; everything until \n is a custom delimiter. 
This custom delimiter should work:
	"//a\n1a2a3a" --> 6

When a negative number is used, an exception is thrown.
	"-1" --> Exception

Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored
	"1,1000,2" --> 3
